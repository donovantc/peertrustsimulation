===================

Simulation of PeerTrust model in Netlogo. Completed November 2012

I did this simulation as part of my MSc IT degree. I implements a trust and reputation environment based on the PeerTrust model. This model forms the basis of my dissertation study and at a later stage, I will add my model which extends the PeerTrust model.
